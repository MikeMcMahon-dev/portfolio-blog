title: "Session: The Flip — Cutting Over a RAG System I Forgot to Finish"
description: "A migration war story: a one-result retrieval bug led me to discover I'd built a whole new knowledge store and never cut over to it. Finishing that cutover — and the deploy pipeline that had been silently dead for weeks — became a lesson in why engineers need PM support, even when the engineer and the customer are the same person."

The task was supposed to take twenty minutes. Load 31 Linux flashcards into my
daughter's study vault, confirm her tutor can retrieve them, move on with my evening.
It instead turned into finishing a production migration I'd abandoned a month earlier,
restoring a deploy pipeline that had quietly died, and taking down every route in
production with a one-character mistake. This is that story — and why all of it was a
project-management failure wearing an engineering costume.

## The system

OpenBrain is my family's RAG knowledge base. Supabase (pgvector) is canonical storage,
a handful of serverless functions on Vercel are the API, and three Custom GPTs sit on
top — one for me, one for my wife, one for my 13-year-old daughter, who uses hers as a
study tutor. It's the kind of project you build to scratch your own itch and then
quietly depend on.

Like a lot of self-serving projects, it had accumulated a second, better version of
itself that never shipped. Call it OB2: a proper `knowledge` table with a temporal
lifecycle (`current` vs `historical`), a controlled taxonomy, a wiki-compilation
layer. All designed. All built. All sitting there doing nothing while production
quietly ran on the old path.

I didn't set out to fix that. I set out to load some flashcards.

## How it started: 31 Linux flashcards

My daughter is learning the Linux command line over the summer, so I'd generated 31
reference cards — `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `chmod`, the usual Phase-1 through Phase-3
progression — and wanted them in her vault so her tutor GPT could quiz her. Ingest
them, validate retrieval, done.

Ingest succeeded: 31 of 31. Then I validated retrieval, and every single query came
back with **exactly one result.** Not one *good* result — one result, total,
regardless of the question, served with suspiciously high confidence.

## The bug hiding in plain sight

The root cause was a fusion-key bug in the retrieval layer. The system uses Reciprocal
Rank Fusion to blend keyword and vector search, and the fusion was keyed on
`(file, source)`. For chat-ingested text, both of those are null — so every text row
in the vault collapsed into a single bucket `(None, 'text')`, and the fusion surfaced
*one* row as the answer to everything.

This had been live for weeks. It passed the smoke tests (more on that later). It
"worked" in the sense that queries returned `HTTP 200` and a plausible-looking chunk.
Nobody noticed because nobody had sat down and asked the boring question: *for ten
different queries, do I get ten meaningfully different answers?* That's not a debugging
question. That's a QA question. There's a theme forming.

## The bigger discovery

Chasing the fusion bug, I went to look at whether OB2 — the better version — would
have the same problem. That's when I found the real situation:

- `public.knowledge` had 699 rows, **all `status='historical'`**, newest timestamp five
  weeks old. A frozen migration snapshot. Zero `current` rows.
- There was **no semantic retrieval path** that read `knowledge` at all.
- The family ingest path wrote only to the old `thoughts` table.
- The wiki layer had compiled exactly zero pages.

OB2 wasn't broken. It was *stalled* — finished in every sense except the one that
matters: the cutover. I'd built the whole thing and then never crossed the last mile.
The code reviews passed, the migrations ran, the ADRs got written, and then the ball
just... stopped. No one owned "is this actually live?" because on a solo project
there's no one whose job that is.

So the twenty-minute flashcard task became: finish the cutover I'd abandoned.

## The decision: do it properly, behind gates

The tempting move was to hot-patch the fusion bug in the old path and walk away. But
the old path was a dead end I'd already replaced — patching it was polishing a thing I
wanted to delete. The right move was to finish OB2 and flip to it.

The constraint I set: **every step reversible, nothing flipped until everything was
verified.** A personal project doesn't get a maintenance window or a rollback runbook
unless you write one. So I wrote one.

What landed:

- **Fixed retrieval** — RRF keyed on the unique `knowledge.id` (a UUID), so distinct
  rows never collapse. The original bug, designed out.
- **Integrity-checked ingest** — rejects empty/invalid taxonomy instead of silently
  substituting junk; deterministic idempotency key.
- **Taxonomy governance** — a controlled tag vocabulary with the DB table as the
  runtime source of truth, a code seed as fallback, and a proposal queue so unknown
  tags get reviewed instead of dropped or left to sprawl. Two tag schemes had already
  drifted apart; this stops the drift.
- **Phase-2 wiring behind env flags** — both read and write targets defaulting to the
  old path. The new code shipped **dormant**: every read and write still went to
  `thoughts` until I explicitly flipped a flag. That made the whole thing
  A/B-testable and the flip itself a one-variable change.

Two design calls came straight from thinking about the actual humans using this:

**Temporal awareness is a priority, not a filter.** My first cut had the read path
serve only `status='current'`. That's correct for "what's the live state of the
homelab?" and catastrophically wrong for a study tutor — it would have hidden ~95% of
my daughter's and wife's notes, all of which were `historical` from the migration
snapshot. The fix: prefer `current`, but broaden to `historical` when the top result
is low-confidence or empty. Stale operational state stays out of the way; nobody's
notes disappear.

The reason I want to flag this one specifically: same column, same query, *opposite*
correct answer — and the only thing that changed was **who was asking.** For me
querying infrastructure state, "only show me current" is right. For a kid querying her
biology notes, it's a data-loss bug. That's not a database decision; it's a
requirements decision, and requirements come from knowing your audience. I almost
shipped the technically-correct version that was wrong for the people who'd actually
use it. The catch had nothing to do with being a better engineer and everything to do
with stopping to ask who the feature was *for*.

**Per-owner ingest policy.** When you ingest a note, the system can either *honor* an
explicit domain/environment you provide or *derive* it from the content. I'm more
likely to classify correctly than my 13-year-old is, so: my account honors explicit
values (and warns me if they disagree with what it inferred — typo protection), while
the family accounts auto-derive. Same code, different trust levels.

## The flip

The cutover ran as a gated sequence, each step reversible:

1. Back up both tables.
2. Retag the existing rows to the canonical vocabulary (37 updates, 19 smoke-test rows
   deleted).
3. Apply the vocabulary + governance migrations.
4. Migrate the gap — 63 rows into `knowledge`, each tagged `source='cutover:<id>'` so
   the entire migration reverses with one `DELETE`.
5. Promote the 638 non-superseded study/personal rows from `historical` to `current`
   (operational rows stay historical; their live version is governed by supersession,
   not a blanket promotion).
6. Flip the two env flags to `knowledge`.
7. Validate.

The old `thoughts` table was never touched — it stayed as a hot rollback standby.
Worst case at any point: flip the flags back, redeploy, and you're on the old path in
under a minute.

And it worked. Production started serving `knowledge`, my daughter's 31 cards came
back `current` under *her* account with the right tags, owner isolation held. Clean.

Then I tried to deploy the code, and the actual adventure began.

## The deploy saga (or: the parts a PM would have caught)

Here's where the "even self-serving projects need process" thesis stops being cute and
becomes the whole point.

**The pipeline had been dead for weeks.** I went to verify the flip was live and the
production API was serving the *old* shape — no new code at all. Vercel hadn't deployed
a single commit since a pull request five merges back. The GitHub→Vercel integration
had silently lost access to the repo. Every merge since had been a no-op deploy. Nobody
noticed because nobody was watching deploy health — there's no alert on "your CI has
quietly stopped." A PM would have a status check. I had vibes.

**The CLI deploy hit a wall.** Fine, I'll deploy manually. `vercel --prod` promptly
died with `EACCES` on a cache file — the CLI bundles the *entire working directory*,
including local caches owned by another user, secrets in a local env file, and a
multi-megabyte vector index. None of that belongs in a serverless bundle. So I added a
`.vercelignore`.

**And then I took down every route in production.** The new deploy returned `HTTP 500`
on *everything* — even `/health`, which does nothing. The function was crashing at
import: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'api.app'`. The router was missing from
the bundle.

The cause, which I will be thinking about for a while: my `.vercelignore` had a line
that said `app.py` — meant to exclude a root-level dev script. But `.vercelignore` uses
gitignore semantics, where a bare filename matches **at any depth.** So `app.py` also
excluded `api/app.py` — the entire router. One unanchored pattern, every route down.
The fix was a single character: `/app.py`. The lesson was bigger than the fix.

**The verified-commits red herring.** Once auto-deploy *should* have been working, it
still wasn't firing on merge. I went down a rabbit hole on a "require verified commits"
setting before checking the obvious thing: the GitHub App had been re-granted access to
the org but not to *this repository*. Select-repositories access, the repo not selected.
Grant it, reconnect, and a normal pull-request merge finally produced a normal
production deploy.

Every one of those failures was a process gap, not an engineering gap. The code was
fine. What was missing was someone asking: *Is it deployed? Are you sure? Did the merge
actually trigger a build? Is the thing you're looking at the thing you shipped?*

## Hardening the part that lied to me

Remember the fusion bug that passed the smoke tests? The smoke suite checked that
`/query` returned `HTTP 200`. It did not check that the response contained anything. A
broken database returns `200` with `results: []`, which is indistinguishable from
"healthy but no match." That blind spot is *how the original bug lived for weeks.*

So the last thing I did was add a content-level check: query as a real owner, assert
real rows come back with non-empty text, and report which backend served them (so a
silent flip-revert shows up too). A healthy backend always returns rows; empty means
genuinely broken. The smoke test can no longer tell me everything's fine while the
database is on fire.

## Why engineers need PM support — even self-serving ones

Here's the thing that ties the flashcards, the stalled cutover, the dead pipeline, and
the route-killing ignore file together: **none of them were hard engineering problems.
They were all "cross the i's and dot the t's" problems.** (Yes, I know it's the other
way around. That's the joke — even the idiom about getting the details right gets the
details wrong.)

The engineering — the retrieval fusion, the temporal model, the gated migration, the
taxonomy governance — was the fun 80%. The 20% that bit me every single time was the
unglamorous follow-through:

- *Did we actually ship the thing we built?* (No — OB2 sat stalled for over a month.)
- *Is the pipeline that ships it even alive?* (No — dead for weeks, silently.)
- *Does the test verify the behavior, or just the status code?* (Just the status code —
  for weeks.)
- *Did that config change do exactly what you think, and only that?* (No — it ate the
  router.)

A PM, or really anyone playing the "are we done-done?" role, exists to force those
questions before they become incidents. On a team, that role is a person. On a solo
project, it's a discipline you have to manufacture, because you are simultaneously the
engineer who wants to move on and the only person who'll notice if you didn't finish.

When you're your own customer, you give yourself the worst possible PM: one who trusts
the engineer completely. I built a perfectly good system and then, as its own product
manager, never asked whether it had launched. The cutover wasn't a coding project. It
was the project-management project I'd been skipping.

The tell is that the *one* place the design held up under pressure was the one place I
actually did the PM work — the `current`-vs-`historical` sorting call, where I stopped
and asked who the feature was for before I shipped it. Every place I skipped that
question, it cost me: a stalled launch, a dead pipeline, a smoke test that verified
nothing, a config line that read fine and did the opposite. The engineering was never
the bottleneck. Asking "who is this for, and is it actually done?" was.

## Where it landed

OpenBrain now runs on `knowledge`: governed taxonomy, temporal-aware retrieval,
per-owner ingest policy, the fusion bug designed out, the deploy pipeline restored, and
a smoke test that can't quietly lie about content anymore. My daughter's flashcards
work. The twenty-minute task took considerably longer than twenty minutes.

Worth it. And next time, before I call something "built," I'm going to make myself ask
the boring question first.
